### Strafer Screenshots

Coming soon..

# Concept 

- Stops 2 keys from being pressed together at the same time, While keeping (the last, or the choosed) key to get a priority on the other one
- Why would it be cheating when people spend 200$ on keyboards getting this onboard feature ? Strafer is Free, OpenSource and a little bit less powerful

# Utility

- Mostly used in CS:GO / CS2, Valorant, GunZ, Fighting Games to Execute some very precise actions or to counterstrafe perfectly without any efforts.
- Really useful in rythm games, but again use it at your risks some allow it some don't

## Start / setup

Soon..
